<div class="post-content">
I just spent the past hour and a half trying to get simple rounded corners using <a href="http://inviz.ru/moo/transcorners/">Transcorners</a>, and I wanted to let everyone know about a little "gotcha" so no one else will waste all that time like I did.

If you are experiencing the background of your rounded div not being rounded ... and the border BOTH rounding and not ...

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/images/posts/transcorner_error-732724.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/images/posts/transcorner_error-732724.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>... then you are experiencing the same problem I did. To fix this, simply make sure the background-color of one of the parent elements is set. In my case, nothing had it set, including the body ...
<pre>body {
 background-color: white;
}</pre>... this will make sure the background color is set and you will achieve the correct rounded corner effect:
<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/images/posts/transcorners-779745.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/images/posts/transcorners-779745.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
</div>
